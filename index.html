        <p> By Chalas's Zodiac, We will determine his personality traits and compare them to his daily lives</p>
        
        
         <h2 class="mac"> PERSONALITY</h2>
    
        <h1> Mysterious and Charming</h1>
        
        <h1>A Scorpio man is probably the most mysterious of all the people in the zodiac other than his female counterpart. The reason for this is that he is very secretive. Added to that is a Scorpio’s famous (or infamous) all penetrating gaze that can make almost anyone feel naked. While a Scorpio male can read most people like an open book, he is one person you can never ever read completely. He is so deep that it may take a lifetime for you to understand him.</h1>
        
        <h1> Secretive</h1>
        
         <h1>Talking about being secretive, Scorpio men are the ones who are most commonly accused of being highly secretive (at least I get it all the time from people around me). They do not open up easily to people around them since they don’t trust people easily. A Scorpio man may know you for a lifetime, but still won’t reveal all his secrets to you. Even the most socially active and talkative Scorpio man has his secrets and will never talk about it. He is willing to die for his secrets than revealing it to even his closest people. Giving up his secret is like taking out a part of his body</h1>
         <h1>Tough yet soft</h1>
<h1>Most blogs you read mention this in a line. A Scorpio male has a very tough outer shell but is very soft inside. His emotions run very deep and he knows that. This is probably the reason why he puts up a tough facade in order to not get hurt. This tough, yet calm face is also the reason why people don’t easily approach him. This, coupled with his non-trusting nature is the reason why he has few friends in his inner circle. It is indeed very tough to get into his inner circle, but if you are lucky enough to make it there, he is one guy who is willing to sacrifice himself for you.</h1>

<h1>Emotional and Intelligent</h1>
<h1>Scorpios are often notorious to make decisions through their hearts. However, this is not true all the time. It is true that Scorpios are passionate and make decisions which appeal to their emotions. However, Scorpios are masters of both emotions and logic. As much as a Scorpio man tends to take an emotional decision, he is also very good at looking at the entire situation in a logical and analytical way, and if he sees it right, no one can stop him from taking that decision.</h1>

<h1>Wise and Mature</h1>
<h1>It is also said that Scorpios in general are wise beyond their age. This is true again. A Scorpio guy may not be a Math or economics Wiz, or a rocket scientist, but he is one of the most intelligent and wisest people you will find. You may compare a 25 year old Scorpio male’s wisdom and maturity to a 35 year old male of most other signs. It is difficult to understand why this is so. It is just that what most people have to learn through years of experience, he already knows.
</h1>
<h1>Moody</h1>
<h1>Let me explain this. A Scorpio person is a deep thinker. When he is dealing with a challenge or facing issues, he tends to withdraw into his shell unlike others who voice their problems. Once he withdraws into his shell, he tries solving problems in his own way in a focused manner. He doesn't like anyone interrupting in any way when he is thinking deep, as he likes to be left alone. So, when someone tries to interfere his problem solving process, he tends to get agitated and irritated. When his "problem solving" cap is not on, he is generally a warm and a happy person. This frequent change in his behavior is generally perceived as his mood swings.</h1>
